# DMUViews (Film review)

At the home page the user can either be a customer or an admin for the website, which both will log in for the users differently as a customer can only view movies and write a review, and an admin can overall do everything in the system from adding movies to editing movies. 

The system will have different access on the dashboard (admin use only) and if a customer would log in they would see the page without the dashboard function so basically view the page only. 

The admin can now use the dashboard function will display movie title, image, description, release date, genres, actors and directors. All these functions are there for the admin to either edit the movies, change actors/movie names/directors etc, and upload new movies with images.

The admin also has access to the movie tweeter feeds as they can change the feeds and upload new movie contains and this will enable the customer to be able to view movie news that are coming out or already out.
