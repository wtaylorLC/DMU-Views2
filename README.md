# DMUViews (Film review)

At the home page the user can either be a user or an admin for the website, where both will have different accessabilities. The log in for the users will be different to an admin as a user can only view movies and write a review, whereas an admin can do everything in the system from adding movies to editing movies. 

The system will have different access on the dashboard (admin use only) and if a user would log in they would see the page without the dashboard function so basically view the page only. 

The admin can use the dashboard function to display the movie title, image, description, release date, genres, actors and directors. All these functions are there for the admin to either edit the movies, change actors/movie names/directors etc, and upload new movies with images.

The admin also has access to the movie websites Twitter feed as they can change the feed and upload new movie contents and this will enable the user to be able to view news about movies that are coming out or already out.
